# Neural_Networking_CharityAnalysis

The complexity of neural networks and deep learning in modern day technology has created new opportunities for all researchers in various fields. Its applications are both wide-spread and has become increasingly accurrate. One application that is widely used today is loan predictions. In this model, we will build a neural network of various layers/sizes to predict whether an applicant will be succesful or not if they are provided funding by Alphabet Soup.
